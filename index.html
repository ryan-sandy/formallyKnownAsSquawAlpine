        <p>Dear Valued Pass Holders,</p>
        <p>
          We know that Vale has just announced their pass policy. Most of our
          C-Suite is working on our renaming, so we plan on copying Vale’s
          policy, word for word. We know that no passholders actually ski and
          the locals only buy lift tickets on powder days. This means we can
          reduce our lift staff by 50%! Please enjoy the horrendously crowded
          tram, funitel, and lift lines. Remember to maintain 6 feet apart in
          these enclosed spaces. We hope to see you on the slopes this
          2020-2021 season!
        </p>

        <h2>Altera Ski Corp: Name Change Announcement (Again)</h2>
        <p><em>2020-08-25</em></p>
        <p>After much consultation with Native American communities, shareholders, lawyers, and public relation specialists, we are pleased to announce that we are still on track to remove the S word from our ski resorts. We don’t have an exact timeline of the changes, nor a new name. However, we are committed to eventually, maybe changing our name. We know that the local community and greater skiing community will enthusiastically accept our new name, even though you had no input or influence in our decision. We deeply and truly respect you spending money at our resorts.</p>
        
        <p>While in the process of changing our name, we ask that you refer our resort as the Ski Resort Formerly Known as Squaw Valley. We also ask you refer to Squaw Creek chair, as Racist River chair, and Squaw One Express, as the COVID Alternative Funitel.</p>
        
        <p>We ask that you stop using the slogan, “Keep Squaw True” and use our trademarked alternatives “Keep Squaw Racist”, or “Keep the Resort Formally Known as Squaw True”. Both are available for purchase. Remember these are trademarked to preserve their true spirt and meaning from entering the community.</p>
