#Resort Formally Known As Squaw Valley

##Altera Ski Corp: Name Change Announcement

2020-08-25

After much consultation with Native American communities, shareholders, lawyers, and public relation specialists, we are pleased to announce that we are still on track to remove the S word from our ski resorts. We don’t have an exact timeline of the changes, nor a new name. However, we are committed to eventually, maybe changing our name. We know that the local community and greater skiing community will enthusiastically accept our new name, even though you had no input or influence in our decision. We deeply and truly respect you spending money at our resorts.

While in the process of changing our name, we ask that you refer our resort as the Ski Resort Formally Known as Squaw Valley. We also ask you refer to Squaw Creek chair, as Racist River chair, and Squaw One Express, as the COVID Alternative Funitel.

We ask that you stop using the slogan, “Keep Squaw True” and use our trademarked alternatives “Keep Squaw Racist”, or “Keep the Resort Formally Known as Squaw True”. Both are available for purchase. Remember these are trademarked to preserve their true spirt and meaning from entering the community.
